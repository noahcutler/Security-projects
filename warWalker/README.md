NOTE: THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! WHILE WARDRIVING/WALKING/BIKING/ETC
ITSELF IS NOT ILLEGAL, THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT OF 1986 PROHIBITS THE ACCESS
OF A COMPUTER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION OR IN EXCESS OF AUTHORIZATION. DO NOT USE ANY OF
THIS ON NETWORKS/COMPUTERS THAT ARE NOT YOURS! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE TOOK
ALL OF YOUR STUFF AND THINGS? HUH? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

  
Hello!
This is a project that I thought about while I was hanging out with some friends. A
bunch of people were on their computers but the weather was so nice! It would be a
shame to waste such a day. But what if you still wanted to get something done?

The warWalker is a concept for a wearable device that incentivises physical
activity with PID (personally indentifiable data). It is essentially a dual function
pedometer and network reconnaissance/attack tool.

PROPOSED FUNCTIONALITY:
- Pedometer
- Network sniffer looks for plaintext/weakly encrypted credentials
- Obfuscation to evade detection

IDEAS/VARIATIONS:
- implement Krack nonce reuse/key reinstallation exploitation attempt
- use data from  WiGLE, openBmap or Geomena + GPS to give the user a route to walk/run on.
